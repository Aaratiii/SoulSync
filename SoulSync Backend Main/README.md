- collaborative filtering
- hybrid model; based on both user and item

  give initial dimension/score to each item in different category
  on single category where we have initial data; we can find other items that have similar score to items/dimenstions and recommend those
  on multi category where we have intial data on one category; we can find other user with similar taste on first category where we have the initial data and recommend the new category based on other user preferences
  on multi category where we have no initial data we can suggest stuff with highest rating or most liked stuff or generic recommendation

  everything depends on user preferences so we need substantial amount of user data to simulate the app and make it usable
